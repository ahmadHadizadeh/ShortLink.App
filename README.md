ASP.NET Core
============
In this part of me, I coded and prepared how to make a short link inside your website using 
[.Net Core](https://dot.net) technology for you completely and correctly, so that I wrote the same code for my website and on my website. I'm using it.
[my webSite Is](https://asancode.com)

## Get Started

Set all file in repository name:ShortLink.App 
And folderName is : ShortLink 
I recorded all the descriptions of this file (short link) as a video in 5 parts and put it in this address for you so that you, your friends, can use it along with the tutorial that I put for you.
Note that the tutorial does not have subtitles and is recorded in my main language, Persian.
I apologize to other developers who do not know Persian.
I wish you all success.
